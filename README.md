# Collaboration Hub
## About 
CollaborationHub serves as a central hub for team collaboration, ensuring that every member is on the same page and contributing efficiently. Here's how it works:
1.  Task Tracking: With CollaborationHub, team members can log their individual development tasks and sub-tasks. This provides a clear roadmap of who is working on what, minimizing duplication of efforts.
2.  Efficient Resource Allocation: By outlining tasks and sub-tasks, developers can allocate their time and skills more effectively, focusing on different aspects of the project.
3.  Project Membership: The platform allows for easy addition of team members to specific projects, ensuring that everyone involved is aware of the ongoing tasks, progress, and contributions of their peers.
4.  Real-time Status Updates: CollaborationHub dynamically updates the status of each task, indicating whether it's "pushed," "pulled," or "in progress." This real-time status information empowers developers to make informed decisions about their next steps, leading to smoother collaboration.
